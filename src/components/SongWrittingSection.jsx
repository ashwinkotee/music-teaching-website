          Whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned musician, songwriting is about discovering your voice â€” and giving it shape, structure, and emotion.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          In my songwriting lessons, you'll learn how to turn ideas into melodies, lyrics into stories, and emotions into harmonies. Weâ€™ll explore composition, structure, lyric writing, chord progressions, and even arrangement techniques tailored for piano and modern production.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You'll also get insight into how songs are created for albums, movies, and live performance â€” drawing from my real-world experience composing for film and releasing original tracks.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Every lesson is hands-on, project-based, and designed to bring your creativity forward.
